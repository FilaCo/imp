## What is IMP?

IMP is a serverless peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol that aims to provide:

* Applications for the majority of platforms (Windows/Linux/macOS, Android/iOS and Web client).
* A simple yet powerful SDK for developing integrations, extensions or custom client applications.

The source code of the reference implementation is published under GPLv3, the license is available [here](./LICENSE).

## :warning: WARNING :warning:

IMP is in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. Use at your own
risk.

## Design goals

1. **Privacy first**: Focus on ensuring the privacy of user communications.

2. **Serverless**: No centralized server application required.

3. **Modular**: Protocol implementation is as lightweight as possible. All the fancy stuff is distributed as plugins.
